# Capstone-Project
The idea of this project is to create an application that will allow college students to "book" classrooms, 
that don't currently have a class in them, for their student group's study.

This code is created in Flask framework and uses python, JS, HTML, and CSS. You will need to install pip, python, and flask on your computer to run it.
Once these are installed, you can navigate to the folder in your command prompt and type "python capstone.py" in order to runn it. Finally, you can open a web
browser and go to "localhost:5000" in your URL bar.
